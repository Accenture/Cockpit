# Cockpit

## Local config

In order to launch the project you need to apply few changes:

1. Change the following variables `jiraToken` `JIRA_TOKEN` with your own values.
2. Build the images with the following command `docker-compose build`
3. Launch the containers with `docker-compose up`
4. Optionally to gain time you can one-shot both commands with `docker-compose up --build`
